# BWT-Encoder-Decoder
BWT Encoding & Decoding Implementation:

Developed a BWT encoder using standard sorting techniques, achieving O(n^2 lg n) time complexity.
Implemented a BWT decoder leveraging the Last-First property, enabling source text retrieval without additional information.
Applied iterative character ranking for decoding, bypassing the need for advanced methods like the FM-index.
